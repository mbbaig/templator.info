<h1>About Templator</h1><hr>

	<div>
		<p>Templator is a website that allows users to easily make and share project templates of all kinds.<br><br>
		   Regular users can browse and download templates locally without the need of an account. However, signing up for an account is easy and allows you access to many more options. You have the option of either creating a templator account or signing in with another account, like Facebook. <br><br>
		   A templator account is <b>free</b> and lets you copy templates, edit them and upload your own templates to the site.<br><br>
		   All templates have an easy to follow organization; similar to other commonly used work breakdown applications, like Microsoft Project. In fact, the task breakdown structure was designed with this in mind. By following a similar schema, the site makes downloading and converting files to project files (or spread sheet files) a breeze.
